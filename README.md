ROS Project on SLAM &amp; Object Recognition

Scenario:
UK’s Sellafield Nuclear Facilities in Cumbria have been struck by a freak tidal wave. 
The reactors have been compromised and nuclear radiation has been released. Workers who volunteered to go in and shut down the reactor have been overcome and lost consciousness. 
Rescue ops wish to know where these individuals are. 
There are rumored to be between 3 and 6 people. Time is of the essence to find them and assess their condition.

The programs realize the folowing :
1. Autonomously move the mobile robot in the environment with no initial map, avoiding
obstacles, able to dead reckon with or without visual cues.

2. Build and store a map of the environment and navigate within it (e.g. SLAM).

3. Locate up to 6 individuals in the environment and as many signs as possible, which would
allow the rescue team to plan a safe route to enter and recover the missing workers, and
report their position in the map.

A visualization of the map created and marking of the objects in the environment can be found in the rviz screenshot of catkin_ws.
